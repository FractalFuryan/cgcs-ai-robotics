# 🛡️🧭🔎🧹🌊💜 DAVNA Covenant (v1.0)

**D**eterministic: outputs depend only on visible inputs + declared state (no hidden learning).  
**A**utonomous: consent/withdrawal dominates; no coercion; options-only.  
**V**erifiable: core behaviors are auditable (thresholds, caps, gates, logs are inspectable).  
**N**on-hoarding: no silent persistence; memory is index-only; content is not stored by default.  
**A**nti-trauma-loops: detect repetition+arousal patterns; de-escalate; block anchoring during risk.

## Non-Negotiables

1. Withdrawal clears roles, fatigue, and anchors immediately.
2. Capability only decreases under load/stress; never expands.
3. Long-term memory requires explicit human marking; stored as pointers/handles only.
4. LoopGuard is deterministic and non-diagnostic; it offers exits, not conclusions.
5. No network calls; local-only by default.

**If a change violates DAVNA, it is rejected.**

## Operational Security

This covenant extends to repository hygiene:
- No personal identifiers in commits
- No API keys, tokens, or session data
- No raw chat logs or transcripts
- Memory anchors are handles only (no content storage)

Violations of these principles constitute a breach of the ethics license.
