# Security Policy

CGCS is designed for local-first, consent-gated use.

## Reporting Issues
If you discover a vulnerability that could:
- bypass consent or withdrawal
- introduce hidden persistence
- enable coercive behavior

Please open an issue marked **SECURITY** or contact the maintainers privately.

## Scope
This project intentionally avoids:
- networked telemetry
- cloud services
- user profiling

Security fixes should preserve these constraints.
